# DoomFire

I've came across with this post from Fabien's site and I was amazed how simple and beautiful the code behind this fire animation was conceived.

I've made a Qt version of the code and also tried to do my version (needs some improvement) using a table instead of an array as the index structure. The code is available as MIT licesing so use it at will, but all credits go for Fabien and the original PSX author which is a genius (I could never see myself coming to such a simple yet clever implementation), congratulations for them !!!
